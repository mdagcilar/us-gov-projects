		This page is dedicated to the Open Data Innovation COMP6214 module. 
		This coursework requires you to take a provided dataset and create two of different and appropriate interactive
		web visualisations. You will be required to clean and perform simple manipulation upon the dataset to prepare
		it for visualising as well as fixing errors.
		The dataset has been heavily modified in order to evaluate your ability to clean,
		manipulate and visualise such data. The data is provided in csv and can be found via the course website. Using
		this dataset you must build a website that must show at least one visualisation of the data. You should aim to
		develop multidimensional (greater than 2 dimensions) visualisations that enable rich exploration of the data.
		The visualisations should be appropriate to the dataset and appropriate for the target audience or use case of
		your choosing. The web page must include a description of the visualisation. This description should detail:

	<h3>Visualisation 2</h3>

		What the visualisation is showing
		<br><br>
		The visualisation of a tree diagram offers a way for users to interactively view projects that are being invested in by the US goverment. By clicking on the root of the tree each layer drills down further into the US govermential data and goes from US agencies -> Investment titles -> Individual project names. This allows viewers to visually see where departments invest their funds.

		<br><br>
 		How the visualisation is interactive
 		<br><br>
		The tree diagram expands and collapses when a user clicks on a particular circle (node) in the graph to allow the viewer the ability to drill down into the section they desire to know more about. When the viewer hovers their mouse over the text or node in the graph a tooltip also pops up showing the full text of that node.

 		<br><br>
 		Who the intended audience is 
		<br>
		The intended audience for this graphic is for anybody who wants to quickly view how particular US agencies are investing into various projects through 'Investment Tilte' and 'Project Name'. Those users can then search on another application to find out further detail, however, for now the tree diagram is just showing which projects are being invested into. This visualisation could be worked on further to display the budget allocated to each of the departments and for each project.
