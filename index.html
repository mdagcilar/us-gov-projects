	<h1>US Goverment Projects</h1>	

	<p>
		This website is dedicated to the Open Data Innovation COMP6214 module. 
		The visualisations are based upon the US government Open Data project investments. You can navigate the website by first viewing how the data was cleaned and can also be download on the 'List of dataset errors' page and then viewed on the visualisation tabs.

	<h3>Visualisation 2 - Interactive Tree Diagram</h3>	
	<p>
		What the visualisation is showing?
		<br>
		The tree diagram offers a way for users to interactively view projects that are being invested in by the US goverment. By clicking on the root of the tree each layer drills down further into the US govermential data and goes from US agencies -> Investment titles -> Individual project names. This allows viewers to visually see where departments focus their attention and funds.

		<br><br>
 		How the visualisation is interactive?
 		<br>
		The visual expands and collapses when a user clicks on a particular circle (node) in the graph to allow the viewer the ability to drill down into the section they desire to know more about. When the viewer hovers their mouse over the text or node in the graph a tooltip also pops up showing the full text of that node.

 		<br><br>
 		Who the intended audience is?
		<br>
		The intended audience for this graphic is for anybody who wants to quickly view how particular US agencies are investing into various projects through 'Investment Tilte' and 'Project Name'. Those users can then search on another application to find out further detail, however, for now the tree diagram is just showing which projects are being invested into. This visualisation could be worked on further to display the budget allocated to each of the departments and for each project.
